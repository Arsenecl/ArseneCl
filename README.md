MSc MVA student at ENS Paris-Saclay | Applied Mathematics, Machine Learning and Generative Models

---

I'm a master's student at ENS Paris-Saclay (Mathematics, Vision, Learning), with a strong background in applied mathematics and an interest in theoretical and practical aspects of machine learning.

I am particularly curious about the mathematical foundations of modern learning systems, including probabilistic modeling, optimization, and generative approaches such as diffusion models. I also enjoy working on applied projects that involve numerical methods and real-world data.

## Selected Projects

- [Score-Based Generative Models with SDEs]([https://github.com/Arsenecl/diffusion_models_thesis](https://github.com/Arsenecl/diffusion_model_thesis))  
  Final research thesis and notebooks on generative modeling using stochastic differential equations (VP SDE, COU model, Wasserstein bounds).

- [Reinforcement Learning for Traffic Light Control](https://github.com/Arsenecl/traffic-light-rl)  
  Deep RL project using SUMO simulations and DQN variants for multi-agent intersection coordination.
