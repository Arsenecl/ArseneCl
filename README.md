MSc MVA student at ENS Paris-Saclay · Applied Mathematics, Machine Learning and Generative Models

---

I'm a master's student at ENS Paris-Saclay (Mathematics, Vision, Learning), with a strong background in applied mathematics and a focus on both the theoretical and practical aspects of modern machine learning.  
My main interests include probabilistic modeling, optimization, generative modeling (diffusion processes), and reinforcement learning.

## Selected Projects

- [Score-Based Generative Models with SDEs](https://github.com/Arsenecl/diffusion_model_thesis)  
  Final research project exploring the mathematical foundations of score-based generative models, with a focus on SDE-based formulations and theoretical guarantees.

- [Reinforcement Learning for Traffic Light Optimization](https://github.com/Arsenecl/traffic-light-rl)  
  Simulation-based project applying deep RL (DQN variants) to optimize traffic flow in urban intersections using the SUMO engine.
